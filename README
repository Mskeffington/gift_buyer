This program is for assigning random nonreciprocal partners to groups of people where each individual is only allowed to be partnered outside thier group.

group 1         group 2

person 1        person 3
person 2        person 4


Person 1 & 2 cannot be paired because they are in the same group.  Likewise person 3 & 4 cannot be paired in either direction.

A valid pairing might be a single path:

person 1  ->  person 3  ->  person 2  ->  person 4  ->  person 1 


A pairing may contain cycles so the following pairings are also valid:


person 1  ->  person 3  ->  person 1
person 2  ->  person 4  ->  person 2 

ie:

group 1         group 2

person 1  <-->  person 3
person 2  <-->  person 4
